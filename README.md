## 📦 Macro Setup

### 🔧 Gear and Seed Crafting Tab

To enable crafting automation, **check** the box labeled `Craft Gears/Seeds/Event`?. This allows the macro to automatically craft **any recipe** you want — including items like **Reclaimers**, **Lightning Rods**, or **Event Seeds**.

> ⚠️ **Important for Reclaimers**:
> Since Common Eggs are hard to detect, I recommend putting common eggs in your hotbar..

> 🍓 **Fruit Detection Tip**:
> For fruits required in the crafting menu, **make sure the “KG” text is visible** in your inventory. Essentially try to have unmuted fruits in your inventory so it can see the "KG" text.
