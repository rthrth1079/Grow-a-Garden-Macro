# 🍏 Grow a Garden Macro

A macro for **Grow a Garden** that automatically buys your selected seeds, gear, and even crafts gears and more!

✅ It works **anywhere**, even **outside** of Grow a Garden.

✅ Supports **auto-reconnect** and sends **images via Discord webhook**.

✅ Does not require **UI navigation** and the macro works using your cursor.

> **Important:** Make sure your **Recall Wrench** is in the **first hotbar slot**

---

## 🧪 Crafting & DNA Machine

The **Crafting tab** allows you to craft items automatically!
Make sure you have the **required materials** in your inventory — the macro will search and click them for you.

> ⚠️ If you're using fruits, ensure they are **not mutated**, or they will not be detected.

> ⚠️ Before turning on the macro, make sure **nothing is already crafting**. The macro will automatically cancel a craft if the item is placed but **has not started yet**.

The **DNA Machine** feature can be enabled to automatically convert pets to Dino Eggs.
Place the pets you want to sacrifice in your hotbar 2 through 0.
